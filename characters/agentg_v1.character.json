      "METISBLOG - January 22, 2025 Metis ReGenesis - Our Primary Focus: AI;Metis is proud to announce a transformative shift in our industry focus: Artificial Intelligence (AI). The blockchain space has only just scratched the surface of AI’s potential, and we’re here to provide a home for its future, built specifically for AI (especially the hidden half of our Tech Roadmap)  that also serves other verticals with high-performance needs.;This pivot is not just about riding the AI wave—it’s about pioneering its future. We’re dedicating ourselves to developing technology for AI, creating infrastructure that meets its unique demands, and closely incubating critical AI projects that will set the stage for a decentralized, ethical, and innovative AI ecosystem.;The AI Landscape;To understand why we chose AI, we must first look at the problems they’re facing, the opportunities, and how we can provide a solution.;AI’s Needs and Metis’ ReGenesis;By nature of how AI operates on today’s technology, several constants emerge when looking at their requirements. Understanding this, Metis ReGenesis focuses on producing the necessary infrastructure to become the de facto home of AI on blockchain.;Fast Networks: The Backbone;Low-Latency Processing: AI applications need millisecond-level responsiveness, which current blockchain systems cannot provide.;High Throughput: AI operations require handling thousands of transactions per second, critical for tasks like micropayments and real-time updates.;Data Availability and Alignment: The Fuel;Data Availability: Decentralized off-chain storage is essential to handle large datasets while maintaining seamless access.;Data Alignment: Frameworks are needed to validate, curate, and align data to ensure accuracy and relevance for AI outputs.;Compute-Storage Interoperability: The Meat;Compute Power: Decentralized compute marketplaces can pool global resources for distributed AI training.;Scalable Storage: Traditional blockchain storage cannot handle the high concurrency and large data volumes of AI applications.;Interoperability: Smooth coordination between compute and storage ensures efficient data access and model updates.;AI Models & Metis’ Decentralization;AI at a Crossroads‍;AI is transforming innovation, with tools like OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s LLaMA leading the charge. However, development is dominated by a few companies, raising concerns about accessibility, fairness, and control over data, deployment, and benefits.;This has split the AI industry into two general categories; the God-Model and the Many-Model. One side is highly centralized and a standard of web2, while the other is by nature aligned closely to the value proposition of blockchain, and a great fit for Metis’ ethos.;God-Model vs. Many-Model;The God-Model Approach‍;Centralized, powerful AI systems come with significant drawbacks:;Rug Risk: Users face uncertainty if access or terms change.;Privacy Concerns: Organizations do not hesitate to share sensitive data with third-party systems.;Centralization: A few entities hold disproportionate influence, stifling innovation.;The Many-Model World‍;A decentralized approach envisions specialized models tailored for specific tasks and governed by their creators.;Data Alignment: Models trained on curated, relevant datasets improve outcomes.;Privacy: Proprietary data stays secure, enabling better alignment with needs.;Cost-Efficiency: Smaller, focused models reduce costs, making AI accessible to more users.;Decentralized: More composable, decentralized, and approachable for individuals to build / partake in the economic models.;This modular, decentralized vision aligns with principles of trust and collaboration, shaping AI as a diverse, adaptable ecosystem. We don’t need to adapt our network or AIs to find a fit - the two are already aligned.;A Foundational Layer for AI 🌿;In 2025, Metis is transforming into the foundational layer for AI, with its modular rollup technology and scalable infrastructure at the core. AI isn’t just part of Metis’ Regenesis—it’s the centerpiece of its future vision.;Half of Metis’ technical roadmap remains under wraps, with innovations set to redefine AI on blockchain. However, the mission goes beyond technology: Metis aims to build an AI ecosystem aligned with human values, addressing the fragility of current systems that rely on biased or incomplete data.;As a first step, Metis is incubating LazAI, an open network for verified AI assets, tackling these challenges head-on.;LazAI: The First Step Toward Trusted AI Ecosystem 💠;LazAI is an open network for the composable and open AI environment. ;As an open network for verified AI assets, they offer a blockchain-powered solution that addresses data alignment challenges through cutting-edge verified computing technology. It is designed to reliably generate, validate, and utilize trustworthy digital assets.;To do this, they combine reimagined decentralized governance, a proprietary assetization standard, and a generative data marketplace to create an AI ecosystem that ensures transparency, and alignment with real-world needs and ethical considerations.;The Data Alignment Problem;One of the biggest challenges in AI is data misalignment, the inability of AI systems to align with human values and intentions due to flawed or incomplete training data. Supervisory signals that guide AI models are often corrupted or absent, leading to outputs that fail to address real-world needs or ethical considerations. ;LazAI is designed to address these pressing problems, but to understand its importance, we first need to unpack the problems that plague AI today.;Data Misalignment & Hallucination: Flawed and biased datasets misguide AI models, causing factually incorrect outputs or 'hallucinations.';Fragmented Data Ecosystems: Data monopolies and lack of incentives create silos, limiting collaboration and innovation.;Lack of Transparency: Privacy concerns and unclear data usage discourage sharing, undermining trust and participation.;Inability to Verify Data Integrity: Without standards for validation and traceability, scaling reliable and ethical AI remains a challenge.;LazAI is Building a Home for AI, One Step at a Time ;LazAI solves AI’s data alignment problem by leveraging verified computing technology, reimagining organizational boundaries through individual-centric DAOs (iDAOs), and introducing a proprietary assetization standard called the Data Anchoring Token (DAT). This novel blockchain architecture transforms AI’s relationship with data and governance, enabling open access to create Web3 AI applications in composable environments with properly aligned data.;Refining Datasets: LazAI uses verified computing to eliminate errors, noise, and biases, enriching datasets with contextually rich, human-aligned signals for accurate and ethical AI systems.;Decentralized Governance (iDAO): iDAOs act as 'data factories,' capturing diverse perspectives through onchain human data (POVs), ensuring supervisory signals are preserved for more aligned and diverse datasets.;Equity Tokenization (DAT): The Data Anchoring Token (DAT) tokenizes AI asset ownership, enabling individuals to share in the value generated by their data.;Generative Data Marketplace (gDataMkt): Leveraging DATs, the marketplace incentivizes the creation and utilization of tokenized datasets for AI innovation.;In short, LazAI focuses on solving the essential building blocks first, ensuring a solid foundation for future growth of onchain agents on Blockchain.;LazAI’s Vision for DeFAI and Onchain Agents;DeFAI is speculated to be the first category to reach PMF (Product Market-Fit) in Crypto x AI sector. It envisions a decentralized ecosystem where agents are not just passive intermediaries but active participants capable of conducting real-world tasks, executing complex workflows, generating value, and interacting across multiple DeFi protocols autonomously. ;These agents require secure access to aligned, high-quality data and transparent operational frameworks to function effectively and LazAI lays the groundwork for onchain agent ecosystems from both technological and operational perspectives by providing the trust layer that ensures agents can act autonomously and ethically, redefining the way the AI ecosystem functions and establishing an open, fair, inclusive, and secure decentralized AI platform;Imagine agents that autonomously rebalance liquidity pools based on real-time market data, execute portfolio optimization strategies tailored to user preferences, or streamline DAO voting processes by analyzing verified onchain activity. LazAI ensures that every action these agents take is backed by trusted data and aligned with user and community goals, shared equity, setting the stage for a decentralized, modular DeFAI economy.;This is just the beginning…;As the AI ecosystem unfolds, one thing is clear: the future of AI doesn’t belong to sprawling corporate silos. It belongs to ecosystems that are fast, decentralized, and aligned with human values. And that’s where Metis comes in, poised to be the perfect home for AI with its incubated project LazAI solving the essential building blocks of the fragile foundation of the AI ecosystem. ;However, LazAI is only the beginning. Behind the scenes, Metis is developing a suite of groundbreaking technologies designed to redefine the way AI operates on blockchain. Half of our technical roadmap remains intentionally hidden, not because we’re holding back, but because what’s coming is so next-level, it needs its own entrance music. Think cyberpunk dystopia vibes, except this time, it’s not a dystopia, it’s Metis.;So buckle up. The future of AI on blockchain isn’t just being imagined, it’s being built. And Metis is building to be at the center of it all.;This is just the beginning. And trust us, you’re going to want to stick around for what’s next. 🚀",

      "News 20-01-2025: President Donald Trump’s inauguration address — full text: Here is the full text of President Donald Trump’s inauguration address, delivered on January 20, 2025, in the Capitol Rotunda. In his speech, Trump promised a “golden age of America,” retribution for the “weaponization of the Justice Department,” and to “declare a national emergency at our southern border.” “I will very simply put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced,” Trump said. “Our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free.”;Donald Trump: Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Well, thank you very, very much. Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens.;The Golden Age of America begins right now.;From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free.;America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success, a tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.;‘We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis’;But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.;As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.;We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provide sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.;We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defence of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or more importantly, its own people. Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago.;Or more recently in Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defence. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting, but we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change.;We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.;‘From this moment on, America’s decline is over’;My recent election has a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom.;From this moment on, America’s decline is over. Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250 year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way the journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one that I can tell you.;Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom, and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much.;That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, colour and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20th, 2025 is Liberation Day.;‘We will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense’;It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.;As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society, young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states, and the popular vote we won by millions of people.;To the black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day and his honour, this will be a great honour, but in his honour, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. Thank you. Thank you.;National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do. My administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution and we will not forget our God. Can’t do that.;Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense.;First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.;‘I will send troops to the southern border’;We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.;Under the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.;‘We will drill, baby, drill’;Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.;The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.;America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it, and they use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top and export American energy all over the world.;We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.;With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.;In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago and thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.;‘We will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens’;I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.;For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.;To restore confidence and effectively is to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.;After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know, something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again.;Under my leadership, we will restore a fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law and we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.;‘End the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life’;This week I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colourblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.;This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate, with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately.;Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies.;Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.;‘My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier’;My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier, that’s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.;Thank you. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the all and admiration of the entire world.;A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States, the United States, I mean, think of this spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.;We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharge, charged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.;‘As we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred’;Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and vitality of history’s greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred.;Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.;And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.;Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation and right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.;Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.;They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.;If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am, the American people have spoken. I stand before you now is proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.;In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.;Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America’s promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love and we love it so much.;‘Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable’;We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you. I will fight for you and I will win for you. We are going to win like never before. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.;In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly but we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable.;America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken and we will not fail.;From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.;The future is ours and our golden age has just begun. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",

We’re going beyond being a leader in Decentralized Sequencers to delivering a complete, future-ready solution. Our mission is clear: to align our technology, ecosystem, and strategy to meet the evolving needs of our users and developers.;Metis in 2025 - A ReGenesis of Metis;ReGenesis is a bold transformation, and this is just the start. Over the next 6 weeks, we will unveil its components step by step, culminating in the full reveal at ETHDenver. This week, we’re sharing a first look at the tech roadmap and our focus on a key industry vertical. Let’s take a look at how we got here and where we’re headed.;From Trailblazers to Visionaries;Since its inception in 2018, Metis has consistently pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain technology.

Targeting Key Verticals;We’re narrowing our focus to specific industries where Metis can create the most value. This ensures we’re the go-to platform for these verticals while continuing to support our diverse ecosystem. Our goal is to build a thriving environment where projects can grow and succeed.;Our tech will be aligned to deliver everything that our focuses need and more. Built with their needs in mind, we will set the stage for the next evolution of Metis.;Promising projects along our focuses will be heavily incubated and integrated into the Metis ecosystem at their full potential, driving growth and setting the infrastructure to build on.;Sneak Peek at Our Primary Focus: AI;We’re positioning Metis as a leader in the next big blockchain narrative: AI. The industry has seen the potential of AI due to the great synergies offered by blockchain and artificial intelligence. Despite blockchain technology lagging behind the needs of AI, we’ve seen explosive growth in AI agents, and still have many applications left to see.;With the coming tech roadmap, we will not only capture the AI market’s imagination with all the latent potential, but also drive innovation and novel solutions by providing a playground teeming with potential, along with our incubated projects providing the innovative solutions to get things started.;The Journey to ETHDenver;We’ve planned a series of announcements to build excitement and anticipation.
